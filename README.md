# Description üçÉ
Forget about the appearance of system's own navigation component, create a new one that you really care for. **Tiptoes** is a subclass of UINavigationController that will make the navigating process more silent and delicate. 

# Customization 
Tiptoes is just like a raw wood and you can do lots of customization.

For example:

- Transition effect. In this repository it supports fade-in-and-out effect. And since we can get the animation parameters, we can create more lovely transition effect.

Fade-in-and-out:

- Everything that related to a UIView. 

# Usage
1. Drag the TiptoesNavController.swift to your project.
2. In the place of your setting navigationController's rootViewController code(normally in AppDelegate.swift), replace ```UINavigationController(rootViewController:xxx)```with```TiptoesNavController(rootViewController:xxx)```
3. Enjoy!

# Contribute
As you can see, Tiptoes provide a thinking to customize navigation bar. But he is not strong enough due to the limitation of author's time and energy. So I put this repo to GitHub and I am fully looking forward that you guys can join me and make this repository more splendid.
