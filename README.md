# Description 🍃
Forget about the appearance of system's own navigation component, create a new one that you really care for. **Tiptoes** is a subclass of UINavigationController that will make the navigating process more silent and delicate. 

# Customization 
Tiptoes is just like a raw wood and you can do lots of customization. For example:

- Transition effect. In this repository it supports fade-in-and-out effect. And since we can get the animation parameters, we can create more lovely transition effect.
- The everything that related to a UIView (because the navigation bar is a subclass of UIView)

# Usage
As easy as follows:
```Swift

```

# Author
[caiyue1993](https://github.com/caiyue1993) made this with ❤️. Inspired by Unread APP.

# Contribute
As you can see, Tiptoes provide a thinking to customize navigation bar. But he is not strong enough due to the limitation of author's time and energy. So I put this repo to GitHub and I am fully looking forward that you guys can join me and make this repository more splendid.
